    "1. Data Type: In a list, elements can have different data types. In NumPy arrays, all elements must have the same data type, which allows for optimized memory usage and faster computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance: NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient and performant than Python lists for numerical computations due to their fixed data type and memory layout. They are implemented in C and optimized for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vectorized Operations: NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, where you can apply operations to entire arrays without explicitly writing loops. This makes complex mathematical operations more concise and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multidimensionality: While Python lists can hold nested lists to create multi-dimensional structures, NumPy arrays are specifically designed for handling multi-dimensional data, like matrices or higher-dimensional arrays, making them more suitable for mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Functionality: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operations that are optimized for arrays, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. Python lists offer more general-purpose functionality.\n",
